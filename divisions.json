[{"id":1204,"date":"2017-10-18T18:59:00","title":"Universal Credit Roll-out","hansard":"d1154","preamble":"I beg to move,\r\n\r\nThat this House calls on the Government to pause the roll-out of Universal Credit full service.\r\n\r\nI am delighted that we have secured this vital debate on universal credit, given the concerns across the country and among Members on both sides of the House. I am aware that some 90 people have put in to speak, so I will take only a few interventions from both sides of the House. I will try to get through my key points as quickly as I can.\r\n\r\nOur motion calls on the Government to pause the roll-out of universal credit while the issues associated with this key social security programme are fixed. I genuinely offer to work with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to fix the many and varied issues associated with universal credit. To understand what needs fixing, we need to understand how we got here. When universal credit was first introduced in 2012, it had the underpinning principles that it would simplify the social security system, bringing together six payments for working-age people in and out of work, and that it would make work pay.","ayes":["172","4212","4038","4138","4573","4667","4623","4244","1511","320","4486","392","328","413","394","4421","4390","4357","1501","4058","4588","230","151","1400","4417","4470","1583","523","1446","199","301","4493","1489","1171","207","4389","514","4651","1442","4402","3972","4610","4419","360","458","4405","1538","420","185","4465","4368","437","4469","1579","4088","1406","181","4391","4122","308","4056","188","1398","155","4488","4676","3915","4683","4638","4374","4657","4264","4397","252","3913","4616","491","483","3943","165","4127","484","4572","4061","4040","1436","1591","478","197","4378","389","545","4034","4637","4571","4614","184","146","4662","4434","4435","4603","4126","304","1484","4432","4466","4365","4120","4029","4400","1541","382","1506","4473","415","533","4645","150","4480","4510","4395","400","473","4467","520","1437","4644","1524","4602","140","1521","210","4363","2","1514","481","4511","4394","4634","4243","1533","4621","4501","432","1438","4631","3956","4316","1588","4026","4671","4672","4359","4505","4660","4630","1439","206","4139","4403","4664","422","4277","4500","441","4640","3968","450","4396","3930","1470","4472","1546","4418","1392","3914","4253","1387","465","4678","4471","4408","4424","298","1491","193","4269","4461","4393","178","1587","4458","4083","4342","4125","4569","4632","4000","1510","4443","4656","1548","4653","3973","3966","4082","4420","4641","4371","4661","4629","4464","4124","4515","1474","4607","4003","4520","3952","4370","4046","4665","4673","4682","161","4263","3924","4670","4356","4268","4620","4031","4119","4457","307","4654","4628","534","4615","166","4521","4409","1604","411","4453","4426","4013","4518","325","1516","4508","1564","4436","4609","4648","3928","4042","4444","4595","4658","318","4463","4425","4504","449","4642","1513","1383","4430","177","4479","1536","163","410","4449","4030","429","167","4618","4128","338","4076","4649","1463","4523","4617","62","4626","4385","1397","4666","3976","1603","1440","4073","3917","4598","4382","4433","4456"],"noes":["529","4491"],"PreVoteContent":"I

That is right and proper for a Bill of such importance. We have heard a number of impressive contributions, including two maiden speeches.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Dan Carden) made a powerful and assured maiden speech in which he rightly talked about the cultural richness of Liverpool. His reference to his 85.7% share of the vote at the election is a good example of the improved performance and productivity to which all MPs can aspire. There are not too many Members who can say to the hon. Member for Bootle (Peter Dowd) that his election result was on the low side at 84%.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Douglas Ross) gave an excellent maiden speech. He spoke of the successful business growth in his constituency and his ambition for the area, particularly for its local growth deal. I am sure that colleagues in Government will work closely with him on that. I am even surer that the Father of the House will very much look forward to sharing a dram of the whisky to which my hon. Friend referred.\r\n\r\nI will respond to the detailed points raised by Members shortly, but I first want to be clear about the purpose of the Bill, which is underpinned by principles that I hope we all share: that tax should be competitive and fair, and that it should be paid where it is due. In the weeks ahead, we will have the opportunity to scrutinise the detailed provisions in Committee. The majority of the Bill has already been subject to significant scrutiny following announcements made last year or even earlier. Consultation has been widespread. Together with the pre-election Finance Bill, the measures have had almost nine hours of debate before today.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition suggest that our strategy to keep tax competitive in some way undermines our absolute commitment to world-class public services and that lower taxes somehow mean less investment in hospitals, schools and our emergency services. But the Government know that it is only through a strong, growing and dynamic economy that we can afford the vital public services our country needs. When we help business to do well, to invest and to create jobs, we are building our tax base to secure that funding for the long term. Competitive taxes protect revenues. Look at what happened when we reduced our level of corporation tax. The private sector created 3.4 million new jobs with an additional \u00a318 billion in corporation tax. In contrast, raising taxes\u2014as the Opposition threaten\u2014to what the Institute for Fiscal Studies describes as their \u201chighest ever peacetime level\u201d, would put the brakes on our economy, drive investment elsewhere, reduce employment and, ultimately, diminish our ability to raise the funds our public services need.\r\n\r\nLet me deal with some of the specific points raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Aberdeen North (Kirsty Blackman) once again raised the issue of termination payments. These reforms are about providing clarity in the legislation and ensuring that there are no loopholes that people can use to avoid tax. They will not affect statutory termination payments or payments arising as a result of employment tribunals. They will not reduce the \u00a330,000 tax-free allowance that exists to protect the less well-off when they are made redundant. We have no plans to change the \u00a330,000 allowance. In any case, that would require an affirmative statutory instrument under this Bill.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Lady raised with the Financial Secretary the issue of whether a statutory instrument on tax relief for museums and galleries had been tabled, and I am happy to reassure her that it has, as he thought, been tabled today, so it is before the House.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for High Peak (Ruth George) raised the issue of non-doms. Let me be clear: this Bill abolishes permanent non-domiciled status. When people live in the UK permanently, it is right that they should pay UK tax. Non-doms already contribute over \u00a39 billion a year to the Exchequer, and we expect the Bill to raise a further \u00a31.6 billion over the next five years. So this Finance Bill will deliver fairness and protect revenue. This is a balanced approach, and one that has been subject to extensive consultation.\r\n\r\nDuring the debate, Opposition Members criticised the provisions for offshore trusts. Let be clear again: if funds are taken out of trusts, they will become liable for tax. As the Financial Secretary set out in the debate last week, our international agreements on the exchange of information will provide a critical boost to enforcement.\r\n\r\nA number of Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Newark (Robert Jenrick) and for Harborough (Neil O'Brien), raised the issue of avoidance and evasion. The Bill implements a large number of measures to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. It prevents businesses from claiming excessive tax deductions, by updating the rules around how companies claim deductions for interest expenses. It continues our crackdown on artificial disguised remuneration schemes, and it introduces a new penalty for those who enable tax avoidance.\r\n\r\nIt is this Government who are tackling tax avoidance and evasion head-on. It is this Government who have announced more than 75 measures to tackle tax evasion and avoidance since 2010. We have seen HMRC more than double the annual number of prosecutions for avoidance and evasion in that time. That is how we have secured almost \u00a3160 billion in extra tax revenue. We secured over \u00a38 billion in extra tax from the largest and most complex UK businesses in 2016 alone. In 2015-16, we secured \u00a3900 million in tax from the wealthiest, which would otherwise have gone unpaid\u2014more than doubling the amount secured in 2011-12.\r\n\r\nWe now have over 100 countries around the world that are exchanging financial account information so that we can track down offshore money. We have published one of the first public registers of beneficial ownership in the world.\r\n\r\nIn 2016-17, HMRC brought in \u00a3574.9 billion in tax revenue\u2014the seventh record year in a row. We have seen the tax gap drop to a level unprecedented under the Labour Government\u2014a level that is among the lowest in the world. There is only one party in this House that can point to a record like that on tax avoidance and evasion, and it is not the Labour party.\r\n\r\nMembers raised a wide range of points in the debate. In a powerful speech, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood) highlighted the importance of the mobility of high net worth individuals. He also recognised the \u00a39 billion tax contribution of non-doms and the fact that our tax take has gone up under the corporation tax changes\u2014a hugely important point to note.\r\n\r\nMy right hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper) brought the attention of the House to the importance of productivity if we are to deliver the sustainability we want to see in higher wages. My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (James Cleverly), who is a doughty champion of small and medium-sized businesses, correctly highlighted the importance of the sector, including microbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie) welcomed the provisions in clauses 3 and 4, as well as the extension of a number of reliefs. He raised concerns about retrospection, but the Bill will simply ensure that measures come into effect from their originally intended commencement date.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) spoke about her concerns at the level of debt, which is really why she should support the Bill.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (John Lamont) highlighted the significant fall in unemployment in his constituency and the importance of growth in driving those jobs. My hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Colin Clark) spoke about the importance of investment and about the distinction between investment and spending.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Craig Mackinlay) welcomed the Bill and brought his professional insight to the debate as an accountant. He flagged a number of issues that colleagues in the Treasury will be keen to discuss with him.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Ms Ghani) spoke of the progress that the Government have made in tackling areas of abuse. My hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge), who is always a strong defender of capitalism, spoke about its importance. My hon. Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse) welcomed the constructive way that the Government had listened to his campaign on making tax digital. In his role on the Treasury Committee, there will be scope for further discussions with him on other areas where he brings his expertise, and we very much welcome that. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Alex Burghart) highlighted the record of job creation under this Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Rachel Maclean) spoke of her pride in the Government tackling abuses. My hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Bim Afolami) talked about the difference between the tax rate and the tax take.\r\n\r\nThis Bill will deliver through supporting families, supporting the less well-off, supporting our public services, and ensuring a stable and dynamic economy. It will deliver by raising new finances to finance new infrastructure and technical education, putting productivity first. It will deliver by raising new revenues from those who would otherwise avoid or evade tax altogether. This Bill lies at the heart of a plan to go on building a prosperous nation.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition profess to be tough on tax avoidance and evasion, to want to tighten up the rules for non-doms, and to want to clamp down on the tax gap. The Bill before the House does exactly that. So let the question tonight be not simply whether this Bill should proceed but whether Labour Members really do wish to deliver on these principles rather than succumb to the easy place of opposition for opposition\u2019s sake\u2014whether they wish to stand up to the avoiders and the evaders, or themselves to avoid and evade their responsibility. I commend this Bill to the House.\r\n\r\nQuestion put, that the Bill be now read a Second time."},{"id":1193,"date":"2017-09-11T12:30:00","title":"European Union (Withdrawal)

think that the 64 hours that have been guaranteed are reasonable, and they compare with the 39 hours and 17 minutes that the Blair Government granted on the Bill to ratify the Lisbon treaty. We have shown today that, where there is good reason to extend debate further, we are willing to consider it very seriously and carefully indeed. I hope my right hon. and learned Friend will take that assurance in the spirit in which it is intended.\r\n\r\nI hope that the House will recognise that it is in the national interest that we put this Bill on the statute book and that we deliver the democratic verdict of the British people in a way that allows businesses and individuals to plan for their future, confident in what the law will be on and after exit day. I hope that the House will therefore give a clear vote for the Bill on Second Reading.\r\n\r\nQuestion put, That the amendment be made."},{"id":1188,"date":"2017-09-06T19:29:00","title":"Ways and

shall have precedence over Government business on 20 October, 3 November, 1 December 2017, 19 January, 2 and 23 February, 16 March, 27 April, 11 May, 15 June, 6 July, 26 October and 23 November 2018.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this motion is to provide 13 days for private Members\u2019 business, in line with what is required under Standing Order No. 14. Given that we have already announced that this will be an extended Session, we will of course expect to provide additional days in due course. In the extended parliamentary Session of 2010-12, the Government provided extra days for private Members\u2019 Bills, and these were approved at a later date. The motion we are dealing with today covers days for private Members\u2019 Bills between now and 23 November 2018. We will therefore bring forward a motion to provide additional days for private Members\u2019 Bills in due course, which will allow us to take into account the progress of business and any new recess dates that are announced in future.\r\n\r\nThis House must balance the needs of Members to proceed with private Members\u2019 business with Members\u2019 other priorities. Members value time spent in their constituencies on Fridays, and scheduling additional sitting Fridays for private Members\u2019 Bills in 2019, with no regard to what pressures might exist at that time, could cause avoidable inconvenience. This motion is a proportionate way to deal with this being a longer Session, and I encourage the House to support it.","ayes":["172","4212","4038","4138","4573","4667","4623","4244","1511","320","392","328","394","4390","4357","4058","4588","230","1400","4470","1583","523","1446","199","301","4493","1489","1171","4389","4412","529","514","4651","1442","4267","4402","3972","4610","4419","553","360","458","4405","1538","420","185","4368","437","1579","4088","1406","181","4391","4122","308","4056","1398","155","4488","4676","3915","4683","4638","4374","4657","4264","4397","252","3913","4616","491","483","3943","165","4127","484","4572","4061","4040","1436","4440","478","197","4378","389","545","4034","4491","4637","4571","4614","184","146","4662","4434","4435","4603","4126","304","1484","4432","4466","4365","4120","4029","4400","1541","382","1506","4473","415","533","4645","150","4480","4510","4395","400","473","4467","520","1437","4644","1524","140","1521","4363","2","481","4511","4394","4634","4243","1533","4621","4501","3999","432","1438","4631","3956","4316","1588","4026","4671","4672","4359","4505","4660","1439","206","4139","4403","4664","422","4277","4500","441","4640","450","4396","3930","1470","4472","4418","1392","3914","4253","1387","465","4678","4471","4408","4424","298","1491","193","4269","4461","4393","178","1587","4458","4083","4342","4125","4569","4632","4000","1510","1490","1548","4653","3973","3966","4082","4420","4641","4371","4661","4629","4464","4124","4515","1474","4607","4003","4520","3952","4370","4046","4665","4673","4682","161","4263","3924","4670","4356","4268","4525","4620","4031","4119","4457","307","4654","4628","534","4615","166","4409","1604","411","4453","4426","4013","4518","325","1516","4508","1564","4436","4609","4648","3928","4042","4444","4595","4658","318","4514","4463","4425","4504","449","4642","1513","1383","4430","177","4479","1536","163","410","4449","4030","429","167","4618","4128","338","4076","4649","1463","4523","4617","62","4626","4385","4666","3976","1603","1440","3917","4598","4382","4433","4456"],"noes":["4639","1586","4069","4411","4516","44","4032","4362","4399","1451","4597","4064","4107","4095","1390","3910","1441","1547","103","4060","4005","104","117","4601","4663","4110","435","4643","4133","4067","1530","3958","4106","4613","3922","1201","4086","1409","4519","288","4492","4481","3987","242","4380","4650","1578","4655","4366","249","4098","3986","4439","4589","1508","1554","3950","4376","1545","4041","4513","1565","373","4008","1425","4600","4647","1388","650","4530","1481","4452","4441","4065","4132","1559","4606","343","152","1542","4116","1487","3971","3934","474","1198","280","88","4475","1405","4674","4451","223","1444","4517","4020","4004","4446","87","4074","1529","4460","111","18","4633","4051","4062","1562","1571","4622","3990","4605","4018","261","1413","4398","76","1555","16","3936","3980","4675","3985","4450","105","1585","4070","1526","1520","4068","3948","4593","3944","350","69","4528","3977","4524","4050","1479","3969","4494","4016","4474","1537","1522","1606","4407","4635","1572","1561","4619","4115","3945","4498","40","4490","4320","4592","3970","4039","3996","1502","4024","1566","4680","4455","4604","1200","4134","4608","1544","4025","4117","3921","4109","345","247","4659","4009","54","1396","15","4611","3989","4090","114","4529","4668","1568","4484","4495","4496","4625","3926","333","4093","4084","3998","4485","4442","4092","1480","4454","4136","1523","1211","4669","4017","4027","4249","4135","3992","4358","1512","4100","1466","1601","4071","4048","3991","4679","4006","4142","4129","4072","4066","274","4052","1528","1584","3939","3974","4503","4075","3932","4522","4401","1424","1576","4369","4507","4423","4007","14","4099","253","4360","4406","4627","4652","3983","4506","4414","4681","1453","4131","1582","4014","3997","1597","126","4021","1609","3960","4118","4478","116","3938","312","4055","4044","3942","3919","4015","4137","234","3935","1482","4079","4483","55","1408","245","4532","4599","4447","4487","4105","4497","4509","335","4531","4097","4462","1580","1496","3957","1500","1493","4091","1539","4526","4361","4527","4053","3940","39","1428","4108","1593","4073","4384","4429","1560","4113","4057","4033"],"PreVoteContent":"Question put, That the amendment be made."},{"id":1184,"date":"2017-07-17T21:35:00","title":"Business of the House (Private Members\u2019 Bills)","hansard":"d987","preamble":"I beg to move,\r\n\r\nThat Private Members\u2019 Bills shall have precedence over Government business on 20 October, 3 November, 1 December 2017, 19 January, 2 and 23 February, 16 March, 27 April, 11 May, 15 June, 6 July, 26 October and 23 November 2018.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this motion is to provide 13 days for private Members\u2019 business, in line with what is required under Standing Order No. 14.

Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) talked about the power of the Executive not only over controlling the agenda, but over ensuring that laws that are in manifestos get through. However, we are in a unique position in this two-year Session of Parliament. As my hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Luke Pollard), for Ealing Central and Acton (Dr Huq) and for Rhondda said, the important thing is that private Members\u2019 Bill are sometimes big pieces of legislation that are too hot to handle\u2014too hot for the Government to put through.\r\n\r\nMany private Members\u2019 Bills have gone through this House that make a real difference to people\u2019s lives. I introduced the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004, which means that large shops cannot open on Christmas day\u2014the Act was good for shop workers who were forced to work on Christmas day. In the same Session, Jim Sheridan, the former hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North, introduced the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, which brought in tough regulation following the tragedy at Morecambe bay to try to protect people from being exploited by gangmasters. Private Members\u2019 Bills can make a real change to people\u2019s lives.\r\n\r\nI am a bit concerned that the Leader of the House says she is minded to announce additional days. How many additional days would she like to propose, and what are the criteria for introducing them? The current logic is that 13 days will be spread over a two-year Session. The hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) made the argument, with which I have some sympathy, that it is in the Government\u2019s hands to move an amendment if they wish to have another ballot for private Members\u2019 Bills in the second year.\r\n\r\nAs my hon. Friend the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) said, in the 2015-16 Session, 20% of successful private Members\u2019 Bills did not come through the ballot but came through the ten-minute rule procedure and other routes. The hon. Member for Shipley is arguing that, somehow, my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda and others who have been successful in the ballot will have an unfair advantage, but I am not sure that will be the case. Other hon. Members will have a chance to get their private Members\u2019 Bills on the statute book.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Shipley thinks of himself as a great filibusterer on a Friday, but he pales into insignificance compared with the former right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, the great Eric Forth, with whom I successfully did a deal to pass my private Member\u2019s Bill because he wanted to stop a Bill lower down the Order Paper.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) mentioned the proposal to move debates on private Members\u2019 Bills to Tuesday and Wednesday nights, thereby getting round the travel difficulties of Scottish National party Members on Fridays. Are private Members\u2019 Bills an area ripe for reform? Yes, they are. We must not only show our constituents that we are listening to them but must enact Bills that are relevant to them. Private Members\u2019 legislation is important.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether the Government have limited Friday sittings by mistake, or because they want to keep the decks clear or to ensure that nothing controversial is introduced in the next two years, as some Government Back Benchers might vote against the Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda made the fundamental point that there are few opportunities in this place to change legislation, but we can do it in Bill Committees.\r\n\r\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge mentioned the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in the merchant navy, which was originally raised during the passage of the Armed Forces Act 2016. We managed to get the discriminatory legislation on the merchant navy changed through a private Member\u2019s Bill with the Government\u2019s agreement. Again, the issue had been overlooked for many years, and it was only because of our scrutiny in this House that we could get rid of that discriminatory legislation on the military and the merchant navy. So I would support the amendments. It is nonsense to suggest that by giving these additional days the world is going to stop\u2014it is not. It is going to allow Back Benchers, either through the ballot or through private Members\u2019 business, to ensure that their voices are heard and that they can make a real difference in trying to get some of those Bills past even the hon.

The Labour party wants to use the NHS as a political football. We want to make it better for patients, and that means difficult decisions to grow the economy so that we can fund the NHS, and difficult decisions to raise standards. The party of the NHS, however, is not the party that uses it to milk votes; it is the party that fights to make it better for patients. That is why it is the Conservative party that is making those difficult decisions. It is the Conservative party that is on the side of patients. It is the Conservative party that is seeing the highest standards of care for cancer, mental health conditions, strokes, heart attacks and nearly every major disease category that we have ever seen in the history of the NHS. It is the Conservative party, not the Labour party, that is the party of the NHS.\r\n\r\nQuestion put, That the amendment be made."}]
